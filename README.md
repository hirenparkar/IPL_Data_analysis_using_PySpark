# IPL_Data_analysis_using_PySpark

This project involves analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) data by building an data pipeline using Apache Spark. The primary focus is on performing data transformations and analysis with PySpark on Databricks. 
I used AWS S3 to store data on it, and the project demonstrates how to leverage Spark to process and analyze large datasets efficiently.
